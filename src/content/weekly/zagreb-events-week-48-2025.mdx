Hola Zagreb!

This weekend is absolutely packed with dancing — and I mean *packed*. Salsa, bachata, tango, contemporary technique, and even country dancing in Slovenia. If you've ever wanted to move your body in any direction at all, this is your weekend.

Here's your complete survival guide.

## For Salseros

### Salsa Grand 2025

**Friday – Sunday | Sheraton Hotel**

The biggest salsa weekend in the city is here. We're talking workshops all day, socials all evening, and parties all night — the full salsa circus, basically.

Dancers are flying in from all over the world for this one. If you're into salsa, you probably already know about it. If you don't know about it, now you do.

- **When:** Friday through Sunday
- **Where:** Sheraton Hotel, Zagreb
- **Tickets:** [salsagrand.com](https://salsagrand.com)

## For Bachateros

### Zagreb Bachata Festival

**Friday – Sunday | Aquarius Club**

Three huge nights of bachata with international artists, shows, workshops, and socials. If bachata is your thing, cancel all your other plans — this is THE place to be.

Aquarius Club transforms into bachata central for the whole weekend. Expect late nights, impressive shows, and that energy only bachata people understand.

- **Where:** Aquarius Club, Zagreb
- **Tickets:** [zagrebbachatafestival.com](https://zagrebbachatafestival.com)

## For Technique Lovers

### Okreti | Spinovi | Plesna Koordinacija — Dance Workshop

**Date TBC | Prečko**

Want to level up your technique? This workshop focuses on turns, spins, balance, and full-body coordination — the fundamentals that make everything else look better.

Led by contemporary-trained instructor Ema Vranić, it's friendly for all dance levels. And here's the bonus: your ticket includes access to a Secret Bachata Party afterward. (Yes, it's secret. Yes, I'm telling you about it anyway.)

- **Where:** Prečko 2A, Zagreb
- **Price:** €19 (includes Secret Bachata Party)
- **Organiser:** Bachata Inspire

## For Tango Lovers

Zagreb did not forget you. Actually, Zagreb gave you three options this weekend.

### Milonga Mística — Duo Edition

**Friday | City Center**

A one-night tango milonga organised by Tango Pasional, close to Glavni Kolodvor. Perfect for Friday night tango vibes in the city center.

- **Organiser:** Tango Pasional

### Milonga Antique — Tangó Social with Guest DJ

## Bonus: Country Dancing in Slovenia

All ages welcome, and if you're under 17, you get in free. Boots optional... but recommended.

## The Bottom Line

Whether you're spinning, turning, bachata-body-rolling, or tango-dramatically-walking across the floor — Zagreb and the region are dancing this weekend.

Pick your style, grab your dancing shoes, and show up. Maybe I'll see you on the dance floor.
