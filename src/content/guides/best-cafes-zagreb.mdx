Finding the perfect cafe for remote work in Zagreb is an art form. You need good WiFi, decent coffee, and an atmosphere that says "I'm productive" while secretly people-watching for hours.

## What to Look For

When hunting for a work-friendly cafe in Zagreb, consider:

- **WiFi speed** - Because downloading Netflix... I mean, uploading work documents takes bandwidth
- **Outlet availability** - Your laptop battery and your social battery drain at similar rates
- **Coffee quality** - You'll be ordering every 45 minutes to justify your table occupation
- **Noise level** - Some background chatter helps, a screaming child does not

## Top Picks

### 1. Cogito Coffee
The OG specialty coffee spot. Great for focused work in the morning, gets busy after 11am.

### 2. Eli's Caffé
Hidden gem in Gornji Grad. The owner speaks 5 languages and makes excellent espresso.

### 3. Program
For when you want to feel like a tech startup founder while drinking a flat white.

## Pro Tips

- Arrive before 9am to secure a good spot
- Always ask "Ima li WiFi?" with a hopeful smile
- Order something every hour or risk the passive-aggressive Croatian stare
