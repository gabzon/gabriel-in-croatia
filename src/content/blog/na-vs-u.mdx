I'm Venezuelan.
I moved to Croatia.
I decided to learn Croatian.

This combination alone is already brave — some might say foolish.
But nothing — absolutely nothing — prepared me for **na** vs **u**.

Two letters.
Two prepositions.
One daily reminder that confidence is temporary and grammar is forever.

## When Spanish Logic Completely Fails You

In Spanish, we live peacefully with *en*.

*En la casa. En la ciudad. En la playa. En el trabajo.*

*En* doesn't ask questions.
*En* doesn't judge you.
*En* is a loyal friend who has never betrayed me.

Croatian, on the other hand, looked friendly at first:

- **u** = in
- **na** = on

Simple, right? In or on. I learned this in week one.

"Great," I thought. "I got this. Finally, something logical."

> *Narrator voice: He did not, in fact, get this.*

## The Betrayal

Here's what happened when I tried to apply logic:

| What I said | What's correct | My confusion level |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| *U plaži* | **Na plaži** | 🤨 okay... |
| *Na Zagrebu* | **U Zagrebu** | 😤 wait what |
| *U Hvaru* | **Na Hvaru** | 😐 I give up |
| *U poslu* | **Na poslu** | 💀 |

The beach is not *in*. It's *on*.
The city is not *on*. It's *in*.
Islands are *on*, except when they're not.
Work is a surface, apparently.

At this point, I stopped asking "why" and started apologizing preemptively every time I opened my mouth.

## Croatian Prepositions Have Feelings

Here's what I've learned after months of gentle corrections from patient Croatians:

They don't randomly choose *na* or *u*.
They *feel* them.

You're **u Zagrebu**, but **na Hvaru**.
You're **na moru** *(at the sea)*, **na poslu** *(at work)*, **na kavi** *(at coffee)*.

You don't go *in* coffee — you go *on* coffee.
You don't go *in* vacation — you go *on* vacation (*na godišnjem*).
You're not *in* a meeting — you're *on* a meeting (*na sastanku*).

The unofficial rules, as far as I can tell:

1. **Cities are containers** — you climb inside them
2. **Islands are surfaces** — you stand on top of them (they're in the water, so you're on them?)
3. **Activities are also surfaces** — because life is a series of things you're standing on, metaphorically
4. **The sea is always *na*** — you're never *in* the sea, even when you're swimming in it

Meanwhile, I'm just trying to order bread at the pekara without committing a grammatical felony.

## Real Conversations I've Had

**Me:** "Idem u Hvar ovaj vikend!" <br/>
**Croatian friend:** "Na Hvar."<br/>
**Me:** "...that's what I said."<br/>
**Croatian friend:** "No. *Na* Hvar. It's an island."<br/>
**Me:** "But I'm going TO it. Inside the ferry. Then inside the town."<br/>
**Croatian friend:** *patient smile*<br/>
**Me:** "..."<br/>
**Croatian friend:** "Na Hvar."<br/>
**Me:** "Na Hvar."

This happens approximately three times per week.

## Living "Na Learning Croatian"

At some point I realized something profound:
I'm always *na* something.

**Na učenju.** *(On learning.)*
**Na pokušaju.** *(On trying.)*
**Na rubu mentalnog sloma zbog padeža.** *(On the edge of a mental breakdown because of cases.)*

Learning Croatian isn't about memorizing rules — it's about developing intuition.
You stop translating and start *imagining* where you are:

*Am I inside this place, like a person in a box?*
*Or am I somehow on top of it, like a person on a raft?*

Sometimes this mental exercise works.
Most of the time it absolutely does not.
But occasionally — *occasionally* — I get it right on the first try, and for that brief moment, I feel like a god.

Then someone asks me about cases and I'm humbled again.

## What Na vs U Taught Me (Besides Humility)

After a year of preposition warfare, here's what I know:

- **Confidence disappears** approximately 0.3 seconds after your first correction
- **Everyone will correct you** — friends, strangers, the lady at the market, small children
- **Small children are the worst** because they're right and they know it
- **Fluency is built** one awkward, corrected sentence at a time
- **Croatians appreciate the effort** even when you butcher their beautiful language

And most importantly:
If you're confused about *na* vs *u*, congratulations —
**you're officially learning Croatian.**

Because if you weren't speaking it, no one would correct you at all.

So here I am:
Venezuelan in Croatia,
permanently confused,
eternally *na* something,
and deeply grateful for patient friends who only laugh *a little* when I announce I'm going "u more" instead of "na more."

If you're struggling too — **dobrodošao u klub**.
Or wait, is it *na* klub?

You know what, let's just be wrong together.
