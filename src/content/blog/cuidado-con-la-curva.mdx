Let me tell you about a totally innocent word that has caused me some problems in Croatia.

## Curva

In Spanish, *curva* means curve. Simple, right? There are curvas everywhere — in the streets, in nature, in architecture. Some roads have big curvas, some have small curvas. You see a sign that says "curva peligrosa" and you slow down because there's a dangerous curve ahead.

Perfectly normal word. Used it my whole life.

## The Discovery

So there I was, walking around Zagreb, minding my own business, when I saw a winding street and casually said to my Croatian friend: "Wow, mira esa curva" (look at that curve).

The look on their face.

At first I thought maybe I mispronounced something. Maybe I accidentally insulted their grandmother. Maybe I stepped on a cultural landmine I didn't know existed.

Turns out, in Croatian, *kurva* means... well... let's just say it's not something you'd say to describe a road. It's a word you might hear shouted at a football match, usually directed at the referee. Or in those Balkan films with subtitles that make you go "oh my."

## The Confusion Level: Maximum

Now imagine being a Spanish speaker in Croatia, innocently commenting on the beautiful winding roads of the coast:

"¡Qué curva más bonita!" (What a beautiful curve!)

You're admiring the scenery. Everyone else is wondering why you're being so vulgar about the landscape.

Or giving directions: "Después de la curva, gira a la derecha" (After the curve, turn right).

Suddenly you sound like you're narrating a very different kind of movie.

## Survival Tips

After this discovery, I've developed some strategies:

1. **Point aggressively at the road** when talking about curves. Make it VERY clear you mean the asphalt.
2. **Use hand gestures** that unmistakably show a winding motion. Like you're a flight attendant explaining turbulence.
3. **Just say "turn"** instead. Avoid the word entirely. Problem solved.
4. **Lean into it.** Say it with confidence and let people wonder if you're being inappropriate or just Spanish.

## The Silver Lining

Honestly, once you know, it becomes the best icebreaker. Nothing bonds you with Croatian friends faster than explaining this linguistic tragedy. They find it hilarious. You find it hilarious. Everyone's laughing.

Just maybe don't bring it up at formal dinners.

So yeah. Curva. A perfectly innocent Spanish word that turned me into an accidental sailor-mouth in Croatia.
