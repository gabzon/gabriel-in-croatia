I'm Venezuelan.
I moved to Croatia.
I'm learning Croatian.

This means my brain is constantly playing a game called *"Is this a real word or am I about to accidentally insult someone?"*

Today's episode: **Baka vs Vaca**.

## The Innocent Beginning

My first week in Zagreb, a Croatian friend gets a phone call. He hangs up and says:

> "Moja baka dolazi sutra!"

I nodded politely.

Then my Spanish brain processed what it heard.

*Did... did he just say his cow is coming tomorrow?*

## The Linguistic Plot Twist

Here's the thing about Spanish speakers — we have a complicated relationship with the letter **V**.

We don't pronounce it like English speakers do. For us, **V** sounds like **B**.

- **V**enezuela? More like *Benezuela*.
- **V**alencia? That's *Balencia*.
- **V**ino? You guessed it — *Bino*.

Now combine this with the fact that in Spanish (and Croatian, and many other languages), **C** followed by **A**, **O**, or **U** makes a hard **K** sound.

So when a Croatian says **baka**...

A Spanish speaker hears **vaca**.

And **vaca** in Spanish means **cow**.

| Croatian | Spanish | What my brain hears |
|----------|---------|---------------------|
| Baka | Vaca | Cow |
| Moja baka | Mi vaca | My cow |
| Volim baku | — | I love cow??? |

## Why This Is Worse Than You Think

Now, calling someone a cow in Spanish isn't exactly a compliment.

*Vaca* doesn't mean "cute fluffy farm animal" in casual conversation.

It means... well... *you're fat*.

And since *vaca* ends in **-a**, it's specifically aimed at women.

So every single time a Croatian lovingly mentions their **baka**...

My brain hears them calling an elderly woman **fat**.

*"Moja baka pravi najbolji kolač!"*
*(My grandma makes the best cake!)*

My brain: *"My fatty makes the best cake!"*

**Grandma would NOT be happy.**

## Real Situations That Broke My Brain

**Scenario 1: The Introduction**

**Croatian friend:** "This is my baka!"<br/>
**My brain:** *Why is he introducing me to his cow? And why is she offering me rakija?*<br/>
**Me:** *nervous smile* "Drago mi je..."

**Scenario 2: The Photo**

**Colleague:** "Look, here's a photo of my baka when she was young."<br/>
**My brain:** *That's a very elegant cow.*<br/>
**Me:** "She looks... lovely."

**Scenario 3: The Recipe**

**Friend:** "This is my baka's recipe."<br/>
**My brain:** *The cow has recipes?*<br/>
**Me:** *questioning everything*

## The Reverse Problem

Of course, this works both ways.

Imagine a Croatian learning Spanish, proudly talking about their grandmother:

*"Mi baka es muy simpática."*

Every Spanish speaker in the room: 😳

*"Did... did you just call your grandma a cow?"*

## What I've Learned

After months of hearing about bakas, I've trained my brain to make the switch.

But every now and then, someone will mention their **baka** in conversation, and for a split second — just a *split second* — my inner Venezuelan goes:

*Cow.*

And then I smile, nod, and ask how baka is doing.

Because here's the truth about learning a new language in a new country:

Your brain will betray you.
Your instincts will fail you.
And sometimes, grandmothers will temporarily become livestock.

But that's okay.

Because now, whenever I hear **baka**, I think of warm kitchens, homemade food, and the kind of unconditional love only a grandmother can give.

And also cows.

But mostly grandmothers.

So if you didn't know that Croatian grandmas sound like Spanish cows...

**Well, now you know.**

And if you're a Spanish speaker moving to Croatia, just remember:

When someone talks about their baka, they're not being rude.
They're just being Croatian.

And their grandmother probably makes *excellent* kolač.
